- In the Gitpod project workspace root directory, create a new file called Procfile, with capital 'P'. Open the Procfile. - Inside the file, check that web: python3 app.py has been added when creating the file Save the file.
- Push the 2 new files to the GitHub repository
- Login to Heroku, select Create new app, add the name for your app and choose your closest region.
